# Typography for active voice

Text lost it's sex appeal since Instagram. Or maybe earlier since Youtube. Anyways&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;moving images and animations took over.

Text had to reinvent itself.

To became quicker, stronger, more precise.

```sh
Or maybe earlier since Youtube. Anyways
   ^^^^^
"maybe" can weaken meaning on line 3 at column 46.
```

This is what `writegood`, the active voice checker says.

Active voice is a new religion.

It chews the fat.

It makes the writer sharp.

The reader less loaded.

It draws attention. Without draining it.

This calls for a new kind of typography, on web, where:

1. Type entertains.
2. And gives precise shots of knowledge.
